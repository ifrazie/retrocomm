# Product Overview

Retro Messenger is a nostalgic web application that reimagines modern messaging through the lens of 1980s-90s technology. It provides two distinct retro communication interfaces:

## Core Interfaces

**Pager Mode**: Classic green-on-black LCD display with 240-character limit, CRT effects, and authentic pager aesthetics.

**Fax Mode**: Vintage fax machine interface with progressive line-by-line transmission animation, paper texture, and document archiving.

## Key Features

- Webhook-based messaging system for receiving and sending messages
- Real-time message delivery via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Seamless mode switching between pager and fax interfaces
- Configurable webhook endpoints with optional Bearer token authentication
- Message history (50 messages for pager, 100 for fax)
- XSS protection with content sanitization
- Responsive design with authentic retro visual effects

## Target Use Case

This is a Devpost hackathon submission for the "Code with Kiro" Kiroween theme, demonstrating how AWS Kiro's AI-powered development capabilities can accelerate creation of complex applications that blend retro aesthetics with modern webhook and chatbot integration.

## User Experience

Users can send and receive messages through either interface, configure webhook endpoints for integration with external services, and enjoy an immersive retro communication experience with authentic visual effects, animations, and sound notifications.
